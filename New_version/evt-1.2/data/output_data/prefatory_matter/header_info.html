                  <p>EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) is a software for creating and browsing digital
                     editions of manuscripts
                     			based on text encoded according to the TEI XML schemas and Guidelines. This tool
                     was born as part of the DVB
                     			(Digital Vercelli Book) project in order to allow the creation of a digital edition
                     of the Vercelli Book, a
                     			parchment codex of the late tenth century, now preserved in the Archivio e Biblioteca
                     Capitolare of Vercelli
                     			and regarded as one of the four most important manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon period
                     as regards the transmission
                     			of poetic texts in the Old English language.
                     		
                  </p>
                  <p>To ensure that it will be working on all the most recent web browsers, and for as
                     long as possible on the World
                     			Wide Web itself, EVT is built on open and standard web technologies such as HTML,
                     CSS and JavaScript. Specific
                     			features, such as the magnifying lens, are entrusted to jQuery plugins, again chosen
                     among the open source and
                     			best supported ones to reduce the risk of future incompatibilities. The general
                     architecture of the software,
                     			in any case, is modular, so that any component which may cause trouble or turn
                     out to be not completely up to
                     			the task can be replaced easily.
                  </p>

                  <p>Originally supported by a major grant from the National Endowment for the
                     					Humanities, the project now continues as a collaborative effort by a dozen
                     					scholars to transcribe one of the most significant Latin manuscripts of the Late
                     					Anglo-Saxon period. Pembroke College 25, Cambridge, contains ninety-six Latin
                     					sermons composed on the continent in the ninth century. It is the earliest and
                     					best surviving witness to a sermon collection known as the Homiliary of
                     					Saint-Père de Chartres. As the basis for writing sermons in Old English to be
                     					preached to the laity, Pembroke 25 bridges the worlds of Carolingian and
                     					Anglo-Saxon learning and dramatizes the close interrelations between Latin and
                     					Old English literature. Though recognized as a crucial document of Carolingian
                     					intellectual history and of late Anglo-Saxon preaching some sixty of its
                     					ninety-six texts remain unpublished and unstudied. In its current physical state
                     					Pembroke 25 is fragile, requiring special care and limited access
